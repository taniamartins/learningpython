#you have a budget of £10 and want to write a program to decide which burger restaurant to go
to. Add code to your burger program to input whether the restaurant has a vegetarian option
The output should say whether the cost is within budget ​ AND​ has a vegetarian option#

restaurant = input('Does the restaurant have a vegetarian option? y/n ')
price = input('How much does the burger cost? ')
rating = input('What is the restaurant rating? ')

vegetarian = restaurant == 'y'
within_budget = float(price) <= 10.00
good_rating = float(rating) >= 3.00

have_burger = vegetarian and within_budget and good_rating
print('You should eat that burger: {}'.format(have_burger))
